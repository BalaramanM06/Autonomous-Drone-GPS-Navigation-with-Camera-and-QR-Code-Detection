# Autonomous-Drone-GPS-Navigation-with-Camera-and-QR-Code-Detection

This repository contains the complete software stack for an autonomous drone designed to navigate to a specific GPS location, perform a systematic aerial search, and use computer vision to detect and decode QR codes. We had issues with mounting the Pi camera on the drone.

## üìù Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to create an unmanned aerial system capable of autonomously finding and extracting data from QR codes within a designated geographical area. The system integrates GPS-based navigation for long-range travel with a vision-based detection system for precise, close-range target identification. The mission is executed without manual intervention after launch.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Functionality

* **Autonomous Navigation:** The drone takes off and flies to a predefined set of GPS coordinates using DroneKit for high-level flight control.
* **Search Protocol:** Upon arrival at the target location, the drone initiates a "descend-and-scan" routine, incrementally lowering its altitude while hovering to ensure optimal conditions for image capture.
* **AI-Based QR Code Detection:** At each altitude step, the system captures high-resolution images which are processed by a custom-trained YOLOv5 model to accurately locate QR codes within the camera's field of view.
* **Data Extraction:** Once a QR code is detected, its contents are decoded using the `pyzbar` library. The system can process and save both plain text data and base64-encoded images found within the QR codes.
* **Optimized Imaging:** The camera is configured to capture sharp, 12-megapixel (4056x3040) images with settings specifically tuned for clarity, such as increased sharpness and contrast, to improve QR code recognition.
* **Safety and Failsafes:** The flight script includes logic to detect if the drone overshoots its target destination and will trigger a Return-to-Launch (RTL) if it deviates from its path.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Architecture

### Hardware

* **Drone Platform:** A multi-rotor UAV (e.g., quadcopter).
* **Flight Controller:** A Pixhawk or similar controller running ArduPilot/PX4 firmware (e.g., Cube Orange).
* **Companion Computer:** A Raspberry Pi (or equivalent single-board computer) connected to the flight controller via a serial (UART) connection.
* **Camera:** A high-resolution Raspberry Pi Camera Module.

### Software

* **Flight Control:** `dronekit`
* **Computer Vision:** `torch`, `opencv-python`
* **QR Decoding:** `pyzbar`
* **Camera Interface:** `picamera2`
* **GPS Utilities:** `geopy`

## üßë‚Äçüíª Code Breakdown

The project is segmented into three key Python scripts:

1.  **`gps.py`**: This is the central mission control script. It manages the connection to the flight controller, handles all flight stages (takeoff, navigation, landing), and orchestrates the search-and-scan sequence by invoking the image capture script at specific altitudes.

2.  **`cam.py`**: This script is responsible for all camera operations. It configures the camera for high-resolution still capture and applies optimized settings for exposure, gain, and sharpness to ensure clear images for the vision system.

3.  **`qr.py`**: This script contains the computer vision logic. It loads a pre-trained YOLOv5 model to detect QR codes in an image, draws bounding boxes, and uses `pyzbar` to extract the embedded data. It also calculates the QR code's offset from the image center in meters, providing data for precise positioning.

## üöÄ Installation and Setup

1.  **Hardware Connection:**
    * For detailed instructions on connecting the **Cube Orange flight controller to the Raspberry Pi**, please refer to this: [Raspberry-pi-and-cube-orange-connection](https://github.com/Iswarya-Singaram/Raspberry-pi-and-cube-orange-connection).
    * Ensure the camera module is securely connected to the Raspberry Pi's CSI port.

2.  **Software Configuration:**
    * Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi.
    * Install all the required Python libraries listed under the [Software](#software) section.
    * **YOLOv5 Model:** This project requires a custom-trained YOLOv5 weights file named **`best.pt`**. Place this file in the root directory of the project or update the file path in `qr.py` to point to its location.
    * Update the serial port (e.g., `/dev/ttyAMA0`) and baud rate in `gps.py` to match your hardware setup.
    * Set your target `destination_lat` and `destination_lon` in `gps.py`.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execution

To launch the autonomous mission, run the main script from the terminal:

```bash
python3 gps.py
```
